 # Data-Science-Capstone

## Describing the Project

The goal of this project is to work with a dataset provided and create an NLP (natural language processing) model that predicts subsequent words. Blogs, Twitter and News are datasets used to train the model.

SwiftKey is the company that prepares this Project, with the objective to construct a predictive model that makes easier for people to type on their mobile devices.

In addition to cleaning and sub-setting the data, the tokenization technique of N-Grams is used to combine the words to be used in the predictive algotithm.

The final project is concluded with both a Shiny application and a Pitch Deck Presentation.
